      <p className="mb-4">
        I'm a fullstack software engineer that is frontend-leaning with a passion for user-first design and intuitive interfaces. I specialize in React, TypeScript, SQL, and Tailwind, with experience across the stack—building APIs, integrating databases, and collaborating across product and design.

        Previously, I worked at a fintech startup in the web3/crypto space, where I contributed to a high-performance blockchain search tool. I collaborated cross-functionally to ship features that supported real-time data retrieval across 150+ cryptoassets. That experience sharpened my skills in writing scalable frontend code, working with live blockchain data, and building developer-focused tools.

        Beyond code, I’m a certified 500-hour Pilates instructor and a 200-hour registered yoga teacher. I bring that same creativity, empathy, and discipline into my work. I love collaborating on projects that empower users and foster real-world connection.
