        “... she is one of the most exceptional developers I’ve had the opportunity to lead. Throughout the project, I watched Cass turn daunting challenges into remarkable successes. She isn’t just a talented software developer; she was the heart of our team, and her impact was transformative. A real problem solver.

        <br />
        <br />

        I am sincerely grateful to have worked with Cass. She combines technical excellence with a compassionate spirit — a combination as powerful as it is rare. Cass has my highest recommendation. Any team would be fortunate to have her. If you get the chance to work with Cass, take it — you’ll gain not only an outstanding engineer, but also a positive force who elevates everyone around her. I would work with her again in a heartbeat.”
